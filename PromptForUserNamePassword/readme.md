# About

This code sample shows how to take two arguments into the application expecting a user name and a user password.

The user data is stored in a Dictionary, key is the user name and value is the user’s last name for their password. Note that the dictionary has been setup as case insensitive.

In a real world application the user name and password would not be hard-coded but stored in a secure container such as an encrypted file or secure table in a database.
